# QuickFit

An exercise generator that allows you to keep track of workouts! This SPA allows users to add or select exercises along with some timing variations.

Fitness is the first step to greatness!

### Background

> â€œI really think a champion is defined not by their wins but by how they can recover when they fall." - Serena Williams

As a way to promote a healthy lifestyle, our goal is to create an easy to use application that provides a simple way to create an engaging exercise experience. This application aims to provide the ability to add custom movements or select from a list of basic movements, frame it within popular timing conventions, and provide visual, audio, and physical cues to the athlete.

Whether you are new to fitness or an experienced athlete, we strive to provide an easy to use interface that anyone can use right out of the box.

## Feature Functionality & MVP

- [x] Workout generator with timer and exercise selections
- [x] Three timing options
  * Counter
    - Duration
    - Toggle count up or down
    - IE. count up to 15mins
  * Interval
    - Rounds
    - Durations/Intervals
    - IE. 5 Rounds of 5 minutes of work
  * Tabata
    - Rounds
    - 20s Work, 10s Rest
    - IE. 8 Rounds of 20s work/10s rest, totaling 4mins
- [x] Visual and physical* cues to alert user of interface changes
- [x] User creation and login
- [x] An easy way to retrieve past workouts to monitor progress
- [x] Smooth and polished frontend for Apple App Store submission/acceptance

TBD*

## Future Features

## Stack & Challenges

### Technologies
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) handles our backend: serving APIs, ensuring security, and handling auth.
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is used for our frontend, mobile framework. Providing quick rendering and a smooth experience.
- [React/Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) utilizes unidirectional data flow for our state's management
- [Expo.io](https://expo.io) is a tool that allows us to build and share native applications across iOS.
- [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) is a frontend library that streamlines HTTP requests to our API endpoints.

### Challenges

The main technical challenges will include:

1. Learning two new frameworks, `Django` and `React Native`
2. Rapid prototyping amongst multi-member team
3. Multi-member git collaboration
4. How to access API endpoint? Utilize built-in Fetch tool or 3rd party library ([Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios))
5. Production hosting on Heroku (not common to host Django applications)

## Weekend Accomplishments
1. Functioning prototypes for both back and frontends.
2. Chris Brickey completed Django tutorials and set up a working backend environment.
3. Justin Austria completed React Native tutorials and set up a frontend/mobile testing environment.
4. Kevin Shen assisted Chris Brickey with research, implementation, and planning.
5. Norris Kwan assisted Justin Austria with research, implementation, and planning.
6. Our team mapped out our MVPs, wireframes, component hierarchy, schema, and state shape.
7. Chris Brickey created wireframes.
8. Norris Kwan and Justin Austria completed README draft and proposal.
