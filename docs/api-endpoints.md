# QUICKFIT - API ENDPOINTS
- Don’t forget closing slash on all routes (Django default requirement)
- These endpoints return arrays of objects
- contentType: 'applciation/json' may be interchangeable with adding '?format=json' to the query string
- For JSON data, keys must be strings and all strings must use double-quotes. If your first attempt doesn't work, remove or add spaces between (e.g. "movement_name":"Exercise1" vs "movement_name": "Exercise1")
- Seed data is located on the initdata.json file.  Check there or the admin 'backdoor' to make sure you are using valid foreign keys.


## Heroku Prefix and Admin Backdoor
##### URL prefix (append api endpoints to this)
- https://afternoon-bastion-37946.herokuapp.com
